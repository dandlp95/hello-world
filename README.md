# Overview

As a software engineer, I am planning to work on projects that will help me solidify the knowledge I have in programming in more practical ways.
For instance, I understand the importance of implementing algorithms, but now I want to find a project where optimization through those algorithms
may be important, such as creating a videogame. I am thinking of creating my own projects based on the concepts I've learned, while I  also get
support from outside resources. While I am looking for support, all the code I work on will come from myself. I will not simply use solutions 
without fully understanding them.

**How It Works**

This Hello World function initializes a while loop that prints Hello World. Inside this while loop, a new while loop prompts the user if Hello
World should be printed again. If the user says yes, it  exits the inside while loop, it will print Hello World, and the inside while loop will be
initialize again to prompt the user if Hello World should be printed. If the user says no, it exits the function and the program ends. Any other
input will not be accepted, and the user will be prompted again until valid input is received. 


**Purpose**
The purpose of this software is to demonstrate how to use functions, loops and prompts in Python. It is also to test that I have the knowledge 
and the correct computer software needed to set up a git repository for my future personal projects and publish them on GitHub.
